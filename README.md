## NOTES

* Special thanks to datawim at https://www.datawim.com/post/inset-map-in-r/ for helping me develop the inset map.
* The river hydgrogrphy GIS data for creating the map can be downloaded from https://ftpgeoinfo.msl.mt.gov/Data/Spatial/MSDI/Hydrography/. The dataset is large and committing it here is too much.
* Many, but not all, of the literature sources that are referenced in the manuscript are available in the `/literature` directory.

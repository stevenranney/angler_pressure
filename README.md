A side project to estimate what will happen to the trout population as the population of anglers on the Madison River, Montana, continues to grow. The human dimensions of fisheries management are often overlooked and the increased angling pressure on the Madison is already impacting angler sentiment. What happens as pressure continues to increase and mortality increases concomittantly?

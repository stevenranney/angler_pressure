# Population estimates:

~~By 10mm length class:

* calculate n_hat from Chapman modification of Lincoln-Peterson estimator (AIFFD Chapter 8)
* find capture probability (q_hat) from spline smoothing (Anderson 1995)
* Find maximum likelihood estimator of n_hat (AIFFD Chapter 8)~~

# Questions for Schmetterling

* Is it MTFWPs assumption that during mark/recapture sampling, Varney and Pine Butte are "closed" populations?

* How, exactly, does FWP apply any sort of maximum or log-likelihood to the population estimates from the Chapman modification of the Lincoln-Peterson estimator? What specific method does FWP follow? I've calculated N-hat by 10mm length class and length category a number of different ways, including the Chapman modification of the Lincol-Peterson estimator, with MLE based upon observed capture probabilities and modeled capture probabilities (i.e., Anderson 1995; AIFFD pg 337, box 8.2), and from model M0 from Otis et al 1978 (AIFFD pg 335 and box 8.3 on pg 342). From these estimates, the only one that gets me close to MTFWPs popualtion estimates at Pine Butte and Varney are the basic Chapman estimator. Where does your MLE or log-MLE come into play?

* How does FWP calculate fish/river mile? Is it just the average of the Varney and Pine Butte population estimates multiplied by 54 (total upper Madison River miles)? This is what it looks like Horton et al. (2018) did in the 2018 report.
